### Homework Challenges

1. Destroy root account credentials, MFA and IAM role
Login to the AWS console and navigate tothe 'IAM service'

![IAM Security Recommendations](image.png)
Since my root user already has MFA, I'll create a new user and set up MFA on that account. 

![IAM User / Create User](image-1.png)
I'll start by creating a user 
Access management -> Users -> Create user

![Alt text](image-3.png)
Then I'll name the account, provide console access, and set the password. 
When dealing with passwords I like to issue a password and then require the user to change it upon sign in. 
ex. using 'Defaultpassword2024!'

![Admin Permissions](image-4.png)
I'll assign this user with admin access since I'll be using this user for the rest of the class. 

![Review and Create](image-5.png)
Then I'll create the user.

![Retrieve Password](image-6.png)
![Login to Console](image-7.png)
Now I'll navigate to the console sign in URL to sign in, change password and set up MFA on this account 

![Change password](image-8.png)
Here ill change the password

![Security Creds](image-9.png)
![assign mfa](image-11.png)
![slect mfa](image-10.png)
![set up device](image-12.png)
I'll then navigate to the security credentials and add google authenticater as my MFA device. 

Now that I have a new user with Admin access I won't have to login as my root user. 

2. Use EventBridge to hookup health Dashboard to SNS and send notification when there is a service issue.

3. Review all the questions of each pillars in the Well Architected Tool.

4. Create an architectual diagram of the CI/CD logical pipeline.

5. Research the techincal and service limits of specific services and how they could impact the techincal path for techincal flexability.

6. Open a support ticket and request a service limit.
